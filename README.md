Control your **Max Hauri MaxSmart** smart power strips and plugs directly from Home Assistant! **No cloud required** - everything works locally on your network.

These are **REVOGI-based devices**. Other REVOGI-based devices might work as well. Feel free to test and come back to me for any feedback. We may work together to make them work.

> **💡 Future-Proof Your Investment:** These devices are EOL (End of Life) with cloud services scheduled for decommissioning. This integration provides a **cloud-free solution** to keep your perfectly functional hardware running indefinitely, independent of manufacturer support.

## 🛡️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Device Not Found
**Problem**: Integration can't find your device
**Solutions**:
- Ensure device is powered on and connected to your network
- Try entering the IP address manually
- Check that Home Assistant and device are on the same level 2 network (same subnet, and same VLAN)

#### Connection Errors
**Problem**: Device becomes unavailable
**Solutions**:
- Check device IP hasn't changed (use DHCP reservation)
- Verify network connectivity
- Restart the device by unplugging for 10 seconds

#### Wrong Number of Entities
**Problem**: 1-port device shows master switch
**Solutions**:
- The new version automatically fixes this
- If upgrading, the migration will clean up incorrect entities
- For new setups, entities are created correctly

### Getting Help
1. **Check Logs** - Look in Home Assistant logs for error details
2. **GitHub Issues** - Report problems at [our issue tracker](https://github.com/Superkikim/mh-maxsmart-hass/issues)
3. **Provide Details** - Include device model, firmware version, and error messages

## 📱 Entity Naming

The integration creates entities with clear, consistent names:

### 6-Port Power Station Example
```
Device: "Living Room Power Strip"
├── Master (switch.living_room_power_strip_master)
├── TV (switch.living_room_power_strip_tv)
├── Lamp (switch.living_room_power_strip_lamp)
├── Total Power (sensor.living_room_power_strip_total_power)
├── TV Power (sensor.living_room_power_strip_tv_power)
└── Lamp Power (sensor.living_room_power_strip_lamp_power)
```

### 1-Port Smart Plug Example
```
Device: "Coffee Maker Plug"
├── Coffee Maker Plug (switch.coffee_maker_plug)
└── Coffee Maker Plug Power (sensor.coffee_maker_plug_power)
```

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

- **🏠 Local Control** - Everything works on your local network
- **🚫 No Cloud** - No data sent to external servers
- **🔓 Unencrypted** - Uses plain HTTP (device limitation)
- **🛡️ Network Security** - Ensure devices are on trusted network

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Device Limitations
- **Protocol Support** - Devices use HTTP or UDP V3 protocols (unencrypted communication)
- **Discovery Network** - Device discovery requires same network segment (UDP broadcast limitation)
- **Control Network** - Device control works across network segments (HTTP/UDP routing supported)
- **Port Limits** - 1 or 6 ports depending on device model

### Firmware Compatibility
- **v1.06, v1.10, v1.30** - HTTP protocol, full feature support ✅
- **v2.11, v3.36, v3.49** - HTTP protocol, full feature support ✅
- **v5.11+** - UDP V3 protocol, full feature support ✅
